So, I had started working on this patch to `print/hplip`, but got distracted
by life/work.  And, when I came back to it found that `print/hplip` had been
updated to 3.14.4, and addressed some of the issues.  Though it went the hpcups
way which is a pretty good way to go.  I decided that I wanted to still submit
the hacking I had done to getting hpijs working...
