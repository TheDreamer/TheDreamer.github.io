While searching around on how to do something with orpie, which I still haven't gotten around to doing, I noticed that
on 04/11/2014 there had been a new version (1.5.2).

It is described mainly for compatability with OCaml 3.11+.  My system is using 4.01.0, so this might be important?

What's interesting is the changelog for this application.

      2014-04-11        Version 1.5.2 release.
       
                        Catch division by zero when invoking the modulo
                        operator.
      
      2010-03-06        Minor changes for compatibility with OCaml
                        3.11.
      
                        Honor custom CFLAGS and LDFLAGS settings more
                        carefully.
      
      2007-09-17        ln() and log10() now return complex values for
                        negative real arguments.
      
      2007-09-13        Version 1.5.1 release.

Wonder when I'll get around to submitting it?
