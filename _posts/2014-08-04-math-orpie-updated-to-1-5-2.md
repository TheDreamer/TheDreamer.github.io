Back on May 26, 2014, I wrote about having
[updated]({% post_url 2014-05-26-update-orpie-to-1-5-2 %}) `math/orpie` to
1.5.2, which ended with me wondering when I would get around to submitting it?

I forget why I put it off, other than the fact that the update didn't resolve
the issue I had with orpie at the time.  And, I had resolved by running it in
an xterm instead of gnome-terminal.

Anyways, it seems somebody else submitted an update on June 10, 2014.  And, it
didn't make its way into ports until yesterday (Aug 3, 3014).  Wonder if I
want to compare it with what I had done.  It seems to have some different
patches, though that might be to make it fit with the overall changes to
ports or the various tweaks to the previous version, such as those committed
on May 26, Jul 7 and Jul 14.
