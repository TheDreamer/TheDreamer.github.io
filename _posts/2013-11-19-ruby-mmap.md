Been trying to figure out how to generate the .fw files for
_sysutils/devcpu-data_ from the latest amd-ucode files.  Found a ruby program
that looked promising, but getting it to run was a challenge.  Especially since
it wanted 'mmap'.

But, devel/ruby-mmap was marked DEPRECATED (Does not work with Ruby 1.9), and
expired on 2013-10-10.  It was removed on 2013-10-11.

I got 'mmap' to build after going through the source and figuring out what
was needed to get it to work with 1.9.  I was going to fork ruby-mmap on github
to record my work, when I found that numerous other forks exist with
similiar/better changes to mmap.c.  I took what appeared to be the most recent
and it showed itself to be 0.2.7.

So, I tweaked the Makefile to create PORTVERSION 0.2.7 from DISTVERSION 0.2.6 :)

Alas, it didn't extract anything.  So, I abandonned thought of submitting this.
